# App-market-analysis

## Objective
In this project, I try to understand the app markets 
as they are become more crowded.
Although the data sets might not be relevant today, 
yet I believe they carry patterns
and hidden information might be useful or intersting.**

## Methodology
Using basic functions and loops, I attempt not to use data wrangling libraries like numpy and pandas
for analysis in this project.
